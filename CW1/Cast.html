<h1>Emily Blunt as Lily Houghton</h1>
<h2>Mini Bio</h2>

<p>Emily Olivia Leah Blunt is a British actress known for her roles in The Devil Wears Prada (2006),
  The Young Victoria (2009), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and The Girl on the Train (2016), among many others.
<br><br>
Blunt was born on February 23, 1983, in Roehampton, South West London, England, the second of four children in the family of Joanna Mackie,
a former actress and teacher, and Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, a barrister. Her grandfather was Major General Peter Blunt, and her uncle is MP Crispin Blunt.
Emily received a rigorous education at Ibstock Place School, a co-ed private school at Roehampton. However, young Emily Blunt had a stammer, since she was a kid of 8.
Her mother took her to relaxation classes, which did not do anything. She reached a turning point at 12,
when a teacher cleverly asked her to play a character with a different voice and said, "I really believe in you".
Blunt ended up using a northern accent, and it did the trick, her stammer disappeared.
<br><br>
Emily is a highly versatile actress and a multifaceted person. Her talents include singing and playing cello; she is also skilled at horseback riding.</p>

<h1>Dwayne Johnson as Frank Wolff</h1>
<h2>Mini Bio</h2>

<p>Dwayne Douglas Johnson, also known as The Rock, was born on May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California.
  He is the son of Ata Johnson (born Feagaimaleata Fitisemanu Maivia) and professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). His father,
  from Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada, is black (of Black Nova Scotian descent), and his mother is of Samoan background (her own father was Peter Fanene Maivia,
  also a professional wrestler). While growing up, Dwayne traveled around a lot with his parents and watched his father perform in the ring. During his high school years,
  Dwayne began playing football and he soon received a full scholarship from the University of Miami, where he had tremendous success as a football player.
<br><br>
In 1995, Dwayne suffered a back injury which cost him a place in the NFL. He then signed a three-year deal with the Canadian League
but left after a year to pursue a career in wrestling.
<br><br>
The Rock took time off from WWE to film his appearance in The Mummy Returns (2001).
He returned in 2001 during the WCW/ECW invasion where he joined a team of WWE wrestlers at The Scorpion King (2002), a prequel to The Mummy Returns (2001).</p>
